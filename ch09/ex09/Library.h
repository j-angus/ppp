 * 9. Create a Library class.
 * Include vectors of Books and Patrons.
 * Include a
 * struct called Transaction. Have it include a Book, a Patron , and a Date
 * from the chapter.
 * Make a vector of Transactions.
 * Create functions to add books to the library, add patrons to the library, and
 * check out books.
 * Whenever a user checks out a book, have the library make sure that both the
 * user and the book are in the library. If they aren't, report an error.
 * Then check to make sure that the user owes no fees. If the user does, report
 * an error. If not, create a Transaction, and place it in the vector of
 * Transactions. Also create a method that will return a vector that contains
 * the names of all Patrons who owe fees.
